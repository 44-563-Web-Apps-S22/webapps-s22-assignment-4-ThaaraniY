    <h4> SCENE IV Scene between Orgon, Cleante and Dorine</h4>
    Orgon.       Hello, brother!<br>
    Cleante.     I'm glad you've returned before my departure.
                 The countryside isn't quite blossoming yet.<br>
    Orgon.       Dorine . . . One second brother, please!  Just let
                 Me set my heart at ease and soothe my fear
                 Concerning the things that have happened here. [To Dorine.]
                 For these past two days, how have things gone on?
                 What has happened?  And how is everyone?<br>
    Dorine.      The first day your wife had a bad fever
                 And a headache that just wouldn't leave her.<br>
    Orgon.       And Tartuffe?<br>
    Dorine.      Tartuffe?  He's in splendid shape,
                 Fat and flabby, with red lips, and a shining face.<br>
    Orgon.       Poor fellow!<br>
    Dorine.      That night, your wife felt so sick
                 And so feverish that she could only pick
                 At her dinner and scarcely ate a bite.<br>
    Orgon.       And Tartuffe?<br>
    Dorine.      He alone ate with all his might,
                 And devoutly devoured a pair of pheasants
                 And a leg of lamb in our lady's presence.<br>
    Orgon.       Poor fellow!<br>
    Dorine.      The whole night passed before she
                 Could even close her eyes to fall asleep;
                 Shivers and chills beset her in bed,
                 And right up till dawn we watched her with dread.<br>
    Orgon.       And Tartuffe?<br>
    Dorine.      Drowsy from all that he'd consumed,
                 He left the table, went straight to his room,
                 And fell quickly into his nice, warm sack
                 Where he slept all night flat on his back.<br>
    Orgon.       Poor fellow.<br>
    Dorine.      At last your wife began heeding
                 Our good advice that she needed bleeding,
                 And she began to recover soon thereafter.<br>
    Orgon.       And Tartuffe?<br>
    Dorine.      He couldn't have been any better.
                 To fortify himself against every ill
                 And to regain the blood that Madam spilled,
                 He drank at brunch four great glasses of wine.<br>
    Orgon.       Poor fellow!<br>
    Dorine.      Both of them are now quite fine;
                 I'll now be going up to tell your wife
                 Of your deep concern at this threat to her life.<br>
